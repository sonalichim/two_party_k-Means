# M.Tech Cryptography Project

This repository contains the implementation of my **M.Tech Research Project** in cryptography **Efficient and secure two-party k-means clustering protocol**
The project explores the design and implementation of cryptographic algorithms and demonstrates how they can be executed via the command line.


## 🔑 Features
- Implementation of **Paillier Cryptosystem**
- Command-line interface for execution
- Modular code for experimenting with cryptographic primitives

## ⚙️ Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)  
- GMP Library 
- Works on Linux / macOS command prompt

## 🚀 How to Build & Run
